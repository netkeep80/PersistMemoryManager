bump: minor

### Added
- `lock_block_permanent()` method to `PersistMemoryManager` for marking blocks as permanently locked (read-only), preventing them from being freed via `deallocate()` (Issue #126)
- `is_permanently_locked()` query method to `PersistMemoryManager` (Issue #126)
- `node_type` field to `TreeNode` (renamed from `_pad`): `kNodeReadWrite` (0) and `kNodeReadOnly` (1) (Issue #126)
- New test file `test_issue108_static_model.cpp` covering `lock_block_permanent` and `is_permanently_locked` functionality (Issue #126)

### Changed
- Reordered `TreeNode` fields: `weight` moved to first position for faster cache access (Issue #126)
- `avl_height` and `node_type` (was `_pad`) moved to end of `TreeNode` layout (Issue #126)
- New `TreeNode` field order: `weight`, `left_offset`, `right_offset`, `parent_offset`, `root_offset`, `avl_height`, `node_type` (Issue #126)
- `deallocate()` now skips permanently locked blocks (`node_type == kNodeReadOnly`) (Issue #126)
- Updated `BlockStateBase` accessors to expose `node_type` field via `get_node_type()` and `set_node_type_of()` (Issue #126)
